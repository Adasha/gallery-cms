## THIS PROJECT IS MOVING
wp-art-cms has a new name, Galerio. This repository will not be updated other than to point to the new Github page once it's ready.

## README

A plugin for Wordpress that adds content types, templates and blocks to suit an art gallery or other place that presents works.

Currently using the Pods framework and Eclecticon theme for development. Over time features will be moved into this package, but for now it's very basic and non-functional.
